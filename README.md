# CreditCardFraudDetection
I developed a Jupyter Notebook to classify fradulent credit card transactions based on a dataset of over 280,000 records. Only 492 records were actually fradulent,
so I had to undersample the legitimate records so that both sets of data (fraudulent and legitimate) were equal in size. For the actual classification algorithm,
I used a logistic regression model with a default threshold value of 0.5.
