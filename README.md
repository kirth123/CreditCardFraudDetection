# Credit Card Fraud Detection
<<<<<<< HEAD
I developed a Jupyter Notebook to classify fradulent credit card transactions based on a dataset of 284,315 records. Only 492 records were actually fradulent, so I had to undersample the legitimate records to minimize the imbalance between the two classes. I used several ML models to classify the dataset. I used a logistic regression model (with a threshold value of 0.3), decision trees, bagging, and random forests. I plotted the decision tree so that we can see how the decision tree makes its decisions and a heatmap so that we can see the correlation between different variables.

I used a linear regression classifier, logistic regression classifier (with a threshold value of 0.3), decision trees, bagging, random forests, and support vector machines.
