# Credit Card Fraud Detection
I developed a Jupyter Notebook to classify fradulent credit card transactions based on a dataset of over 280,000 records. Only 492 records were actually fradulent, so I had to undersample the legitimate records to minimize the imbalance between the two classes. I used several ML models to classify the dataset. I used a logistic regression model (with a threshold value of 0.3), decision trees, bagging, and random forests. I plotted the decision tree so that we can see how the decision tree makes its decisions and a heatmap so that we can see which varibles have the strongest correlations with each other.
